/**
 * Read all ye' who enter this wretched file:
 *
 * I'm pretty sure the sky is an entity on the old game.
 * I think each player was given his own "Sky", or there was at least
 * one main Sky entity.
 *
 * The reason for this is because in the old client code,
 * the sky has an (x, y) property which is used within
 * the parllalax draw function.
 *
 * I tried doing the parallax relative to the game camera,
 * but the sky just flies by.
 *
 * However, when I set the sky's coordinates to the center
 * of the player's view and THEN apply the parallax,
 * the sky looks a lot more like what was in the
 * original game.
 *
 * In my opinion, there is no point in making
 * the sky an entity that has to be networked,
 * becuase the sky has nothing to do with the game.
 * It is purely visual.
 *
 * I just do some hacky shit to make the sky
 * appear in the middle of the screen, and apply the parallax.
 *
 * Then I manually create two rectangles, one at the top
 * and one at the bottom of the sky.
 *
 * This is to extend the top and bottom sky colors
 * when the texture runs out.
 *
 * This may or may not need to be improved in the future,
 * depending on how well it holds up to criticism from players
 * and if it looks believable in-game.
